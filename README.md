# 📌 GenAI Root Cause Analyzer (Fishbone Method)

## 🚀 Overview

**GenAI Root Cause Analyzer** is an AI-powered tool that helps users identify and solve problems using the **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Method**. This tool generates **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reports** along with **prevention action plans** based on user-input failure causes.

### 🎯 Key Features

✅ **AI-Generated RCA Reports** - Get detailed analysis using Fishbone methodology.\
✅ **Auto-Suggested Preventive Actions** - Receive best practices for problem-solving.\
✅ **No API Key Required** - Works locally without dependencies on paid APIs.\
✅ **Google Colab Compatible** - Run the tool seamlessly in Google Colab.\
✅ **Easy to Use** - Simple input prompts for beginners and experts alike.
